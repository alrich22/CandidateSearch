# CandidateSearc

## Description

This is a simple web application using GitHubs Public API to fetch random users, and bring them to you in object format so you can sort through them as a list of "candidates" or potential hires. This app can be used by anyone, but usually would be start up businesses, small establishments, or freelancers looking to outsource some of their work. 

## Installation

Simply install from the GitHub Repository and open in VSCode

## Usage

To use this application, once installed, navitage into the "environment" folder, and enter your github personal API key access token where it says to. Now, open the root folder in your local terminal and run the command "npm run dev". This will start a local vite server on your system with the API working, and use the "+" to add the candidate to your list for further research, or the "-" to skip adding them to your list.
